# Understanding the Spectral Bias of Coordinate Based MLPs Via Training Dynamics

Here we provide the code to reproduce the experiments for "Understanding the Spectral Bias of Coordinate Based MLPs Via Training Dynamics". Each file contains a single experiment that was provided in the main text or supplemental material. We demonstrate the connection between the network's expressive power across the signal and its relation to the speed of gradient descent convergence for components of varying frequency.

# Requirements

* `PyTorch 1.11`
* `Matplotlib 3.5.1`
* `PIL 9.0.1`
* `skimage 0.19.2`
* `scipy 1.7.3`
